# moddBlockly

Blockly implementation for moddScript.

# How to use

## Installation

Make sure you have nodeJS installed along with git.

Run the following commands in Command Prompt / Terminal in the location you want to copy this repository in:

```
git clone https://github.com/bruh-9000/moddBlockly
cd moddBlockly
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

You will now be able to drag around blocks and create moddScript. In Modd.io version 2.1.6 and above, you can go into Inline View and paste the created code to use it.

Alternatively, in versions below 2.1.6, you can go to [this link](https://moddio.github.io/script-editor/iframe.html?id=textscripteditormultiline--editor&viewMode=story) and paste your created code on the right side of the screen. Then, copy the code outputted on the left side. In Modd.io, go to JSON view and paste this code. Newer features might not work in older versions of the game, so using this for older versions of Modd.io might not work for your game.
